    	This program will allow us to view what a certain volume of cups would be in
    	tablespoons, teaspoons etc.
	
    	This program will need the number of cups from the user.
    	Then the program will output the neccessary teaspoons, tablespoons etc.
	
	                    4 cups equals 4 * 48 = 192 teaspoons
	                    4 cups equals 4 * 16 =  64 tablespoons
	                    4 cups equals 4 * 8   =  32 ounces
	                    4 cups equals 4 * 0.5   =  2 pints
	                    4 cups equals 4 * 0.25   =  1 quart
	                    4 cups equals 4 * 0.0625   =   0.2500 gallon
						
    	java.util and java.text will be used
	
    	The input and output will be simple text based interactions using 
    	system.out.Println and scanner
	
    	Psuedocode: 
				Output a welcome message
				Output a message that describes what the program will do
				Output a message requesting the number cups the user wishes to 
				convert
				
				read the input value and store it
				
				calculate the teaspoons, tablespoons etc and store it.
				
				output a message that displays this values so the user can see
				it
